Computer systems supporting multiprogramming or multitasking execute multiple programs tasks concurrently. One of the objectives of multiprogramming is to maximize resource utilization, which is achieved by sharing system resources amongst multiple user and system processes. 
Efficient resource sharing depends on efficient scheduling of competing processes. Uniprocessor scheduling involves only one processor and can execute only one process at a time. Remaining all other processes should wait until the dispatcher dispatches it. 
Dispatcher is a CPU scheduler, which schedules a process from main memory to processor among the competing processes. There are three types of scheduler in an OS namely long-term scheduler, mid-term scheduler and short-term scheduler. As processor is the most important resource, CPU scheduling becomes very important in achieving the system design goals. 
Many algorithms have been designed to implement CPU scheduling. Design methods include analytic modelling, deterministic modelling and simulations. 
The main objective of this project is to compare between algorithms: FCFS, SJF, Priority, RR Scheduling, which help to improve the CPU efficiency in real time and time-sharing operating system. 

Above mentioned algorithms have been compared on the basis of avg. waiting time and avg. turnaround time. The program also includes a process execution gantt chart.
